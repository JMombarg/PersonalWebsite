								<h2>My research</h2>
								<p>Asteroseismic modelling of intermediate-mass stars</p>
							</header>
							<p>
								Two of the most impactful open questions in stellar structure and evolution theory concern the mechanism(s) driving
								the transport of chemical elements and angular momentum. The physical mechanisms at play and the corresponding efficiencies
								are not fully understood at present. A better understanding of these mechanisms is of great importance to many fields of astrophysics,
								such as studies of chemical enrichment, evolved stars and stellar remnants, galactic archeology, and exoplanets, as these all rely 
								on accurate predictions of stellar evolution. 
							</p>
							<p>
								Asteroseismology, the study of stellar pulsations, has proven to be a powerful tool in constraining stellar interiors to high precision.
								The so-called <i>gravity (g) modes</i> are oscillations restored by the buoyancy force and are most sensitive to properties of the deep stellar interior.
								These stellar pulsations are described by spherical harmonics. The animations below illustrate what these spherical harmonics look like (in real stars the amplitudes are much smaller).

								My PhD research focusses on studying a unique sample of pulsating F-type g-mode variables, known as gamma Doradus stars. The main purpose of my PhD is to 
								provide empirical constraints to investigate the relations between the efficiency of chemical mixing and angular momentum transport as a function of 
								stellar mass, age, and rotation. I am taking a forward modelling approach, confronting long time-base photometry from the NASA <i>Kepler</i> space telescope
								with stellar structure and evolution models, and stellar pulsation models.

									<h3>Asteroseismic masses, ages, and core properties of &gamma; Doradus stars using gravito-inertial dipole modes and spectroscopy</h3>
								</header>
								<p>
									We successfully inferred (core) masses and hydrogen mass fractions in the convective core (used as a proxy for age) for a sample of 37 F-type g-mode pulsators,
									relying on a newly developed statistical method to perform ensemble modelling. As asteroseismic input, we used the so-called <it>buoyancy travel time</it>,
									a quantity which depends on the Brunt-Väisälä frequency (in turn dependent on the thermal and chemical stratification). This buoyancy travel time can be extracted simultaneously
									with the star's near-core rotation frequency from the observed g-mode frequencies. We developed a new method which combines this asteroseismic diagnostic with 
									the effective temperature and surface gravity determined from spectroscopy, in order to measure the aforementioned stellar parameters.

									<h3>Asteroseismic Modeling of Gravity Modes in Slowly Rotating A/F Stars with Radiative Levitation</h3>
								</header>
								<p>
									It is known from first principles that microscopic mixing, i.e. atomic diffusion and radiative levitation, occurs in stars. Yet, radiative levitation is often 
									ignored because of computational reasons. We modelled the observed g-mode pulsation frequencies of two slowly rotating stars, for which the counteraction of 
									microscopic mixing by rotationally-induced mixing is expected to be minimal. The modelling was done for models with and without microscopic mixing, 
									illustrating that even though these processes are often ignored for computational reasons, they strongly affect mass and age determination of F-type stars. 
									For one star, the agreement between the predicted and observed mode periods is improved by a statistically significant amount when models with microscopic diffusion are used. 
									Moreover, when microscopic mixing is included, the evolution of the surface abundances can be used as additional constraints in the modelling. 
									We found that several measured surface abundances of this one star are also indeed better explained by models with microscopic mixing included.

									<h3>Constraining stellar evolution theory with asteroseismology of &gamma; Doradus stars using deep learning. Stellar masses, ages, and core-boundary mixing</h3>
								</header>
								<p>
									In my latest paper, I improved upon the modelling method based on the buoyancy travel time by performing a more detailed modelling of the individual mode periods of each star.
									This way, we were able to measure mixing efficiencies at the convective core boundary (needed for accurate estimates of stellar ages). 
									To do so, I implemented deep learning to solve the problem of high dimensionality, which has always been a showstopper in the modelling of a large sample of stars. 
									I trained a neural network for Computing Pulsation Periods and Photospheric Observables (C-3PO) on a grid of 1D <a href="http://mesa.sourceforge.net/">MESA</a>
									stellar evolution models and <a href="https://gyre.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html">GYRE</a> pulsation models to predict mode periods, effective temperatures, 
									surface gravitites, and luminosities, for a given set of stellar input parameters. This way, we were able to probe the efficiency of core-boundary mixing 
									(convective core overshoot) on a massive scale. We showed that the efficiency of core-boundary mixing for these single F-type stars exhibits no clear correlation
									with stellar mass, age or rotation.
